    <h1>console.opened: / first steps into webdev</h1>
    <time datetime="2025-06-30">June 30, 2025</time><br />
    <p>This week, I officially opened the terminal on my web development journey — both literally and figuratively.
      It’s been a busy week of syntax and rules, but it has been a fantastic experience!</p><br />

    <h3>first impressions</h3>
    <p>I never thought this would be a path I would choose in life. I spent decades honing my skills in customer
      service and sales, never giving Web Development a thought beyond making a website on SquareSpace back in 2018.
      But here we are, it is time for a career change and this has piqued my interest for long enough that my brain
      won't get bored of it.</p> <br />
    <p>
      I looked high and low for an avenue to learn web development that would be effective, engaging, and not
      overwhelming. I considered going back to university to aquire another degree, but that felt silly (absolutely no
      problem with others doing it, just not for me). I stumbled upon a few online courses, but they felt too rigid
      and impersonal. Then I found CodeAcademy. Hands on experience coding, as well as building a nice little
      portfolio for myself.</p><br />
    </p>

    <h3>what i learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How to build a basic webpage with HTML</li>
      <li>Applying styles with CSS — and breaking them repeatedly</li>
      <li>The terrifying but satisfying process of pushing code to GitHub</li>
      <li>How to set up a terminal-style blog (this one! css is hard y'all)</li>
    </ul><br />

    <h3>struggles</h3>
    <p>Positioning elements with CSS felt like trying to push an axehound through the eye of a needle (iykyk), but it
      is slowly starting to click. I also am having a hard time remembering some terminology of syntax, but spaced
      repitition in obsidian.md will help with that!</p><br />

    <h3>small wins</h3>
    <p>I managed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Push my first commit to GitHub</li>
      <li>Customize the layout and colors of this blog</li>
      <li>Understand the basics of semantic HTML</li>
    </ul><br />

    <h3>what's next</h3>
    <p>Next week, I'm diving deeper into CSS layouts, learning Flexbox, making websites more responsive, and hopefully
      I will begin to dig into JavaScript.</p><br />
