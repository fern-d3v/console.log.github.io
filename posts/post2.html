    <p>Notes, and the organization of said notes is one of my favorite things in this world. I started using
        <strong>Obsidian.md</strong> it was for ttrpg (table-top role playing games, I play a
        bi-weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons with my roommates and our friends, I am also preparing to run a
        new system called Shadowdark RPG) purposes. It changed the game for my note-taking during sessions as
        well as my prep for the upcoming campaign! So I thought why not use it to assist me in learning WebDev?</p><br/>

    <h3>what is obsidian?</h3>
    <p><strong>Obsidian.md</strong> is a markdown style text editing software that stores your files in a "vault" (folder hosted either
        locally or through multiple forms of onlinle synching. I use google drive for this personally). It comes pretty bare bones, which is
        nice for getting to know the software and how it functions. Luckily there are a bunch of youtubers out there
        who use obsidian, which makes finding answers to questions so much easier! You can do a lot with obsidian,
        below is an image of my "home page" which I use daily to track my WebDev learning.

    </div>
    <p>just a little after note, that progress bar nearly broke my brain with trying to learn "dataview"
    queries (maybe a post on that at another time)</p><br />

    <h3>what i do with it</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>track all of my learning courses</li>
        <li>create unique notes based on templates i made</li>
        <li>track goals and progress of projects</li>
        <li>as a home for all of my resources and useful links for WebDev</li>
        <li>basically it's just my second brain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have started using the zettelkasten method for taking atomic notes and this has helped my brain link concepts together
    while i study WebDev. Templater has been another one of those indispensible plugins for me. With it I am able to set up predefined
    templates that I can create unique notes from with autofilled fields based on specific imputs. It really is a crazy powerful
    tool to save time (there is some up-front time spent, but the overall time savings is absolutely worth it).</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>struggles</h3>
    <p>Oh look, it's another time! So the dataview plugin allows you to make advanced queries over your entire vault. I use this to 
    see lists usually of open projects and zettels. I also use this for my vault index to show tables with all of my files organized 
    neatly for me.</p><br/>

    <h3>small wins</h3>
    <p>This week was a whirlwind of learning. I honestly am most proud of this blog. A week ago, if you told me I would be able to write
    the html and css for this, I would have laughed at you and asked which ai I was going to use. But here we are. Silly as it may sound, if 
    I hadn't been using <strong>Obsidian</strong> to study, I don't think I would be able to do any of this!</p><br/>

    <h3>what's next?</h3>
    <p>This week is more css and finalizing the "Web-Developoment Foundations" section of my learning path. Keep an eye on the blog for small
    functionality tweaks here and there. I initiated one with this post and I will be excited if someone can find it. I also may initiate a comment
    feature in the future, but that feels like it will be a further goal.</p><br/>
