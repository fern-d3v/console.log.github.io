        <p>Notes, and the organization of said notes is one of my favorite things in this world. I started using
            <strong>Obsidian.md</strong> it was for ttrpg (table-top role playing games, I play a
            bi-weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons with my roommates and our friends, I am also preparing to run a
            new system called Shadowdark RPG) purposes. It changed the game for my note-taking during sessions as
            well as my prep for the upcoming campaign! So I thought why not use it to assist me in learning WebDev?
        </p><br />

        <h3>what is obsidian?</h3>
        <p><strong>Obsidian.md</strong> is a markdown style text editing software that stores your files in a "vault"
            (folder hosted either
            locally or through multiple forms of onlinle synching. I use google drive for this personally). It comes
            pretty bare bones, which is
            nice for getting to know the software and how it functions. Luckily there are a bunch of youtubers out there
            who use obsidian, which makes finding answers to questions so much easier! You can do a lot with obsidian,
            below is an image of my "home page" which I use daily to track my WebDev learning.
        </p><br />
        <div class="obsidian-content">
            <img src="../assets/obsidian.home.JPG" alt="obsidian home page for webdev" />
        </div>
        <p>just a little after note, that progress bar nearly broke my brain with trying to learn "dataview"
            queries (maybe a post on that at another time)</p><br />

        <h3>what i do with it</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>track all of my learning courses</li>
            <li>create unique notes based on templates i made</li>
            <li>track goals and progress of projects</li>
            <li>as a home for all of my resources and useful links for WebDev</li>
            <li>basically it's just my second brain</li>
        </ul><br />
        <p>I have started using the zettelkasten method for taking atomic notes and this has helped my brain link
            concepts together
            while i study WebDev. Templater has been another one of those indispensible plugins for me. With it I am
            able to set up predefined
            templates that I can create unique notes from with autofilled fields based on specific imputs. It really is
            a crazy powerful
            tool to save time (there is some up-front time spent, but the overall time savings is absolutely worth it).
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>struggles</h3>
        <p>Oh look, it's another time! So the dataview plugin allows you to make advanced queries over your entire
            vault. I use this to
            see lists usually of open projects and zettels. I also use this for my vault index to show tables with all
            of my files organized
            neatly for me.</p><br />

        <h3>small wins</h3>
        <p>This week was a whirlwind of learning. I honestly am most proud of this blog. A week ago, if you told me I
            would be able to write
            the html and css for this, I would have laughed at you and asked which ai I was going to use. But here we
            are. Silly as it may sound, if
            I hadn't been using <strong>Obsidian</strong> to study, I don't think I would be able to do any of this!</p>
        <br />

        <h3>what's next?</h3>
        <p>This week is more css and finalizing the "Web-Developoment Foundations" section of my learning path. Keep an
            eye on the blog for small
            functionality tweaks here and there. I initiated one with this post and I will be excited if someone can
            find it. I also may initiate a comment
            feature in the future, but that feels like it will be a further goal.</p><br />
